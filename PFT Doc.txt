Project Title: **Personal Finance Tracker (PFT)**

Developer: Rafid Elahi
Stack: React.js, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL / MySQL, Prisma ORM, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript (optional)

üìå Objective

The Personal Finance Tracker (PFT) is a full-stack web application designed to help individuals manage and track their personal finances in a structured and automated way. It replaces manual spreadsheet-based bookkeeping by providing users with an intuitive, responsive, and real-time financial dashboard.

üìà Core Features

1. User Authentication & Authorization

* Secure user registration and login system
* JWT/Session-based authentication
* Role-based access (initially just user-level roles)

2. Account Types & Balance Tracking

Users can define and manage multiple types of financial accounts:

**Cash**
**Bank Account(s)**
**E-Wallet (e.g., Touch n Go)**
**Others (custom)**

Each account will have:

* Starting balance
* Current balance
* Transaction history

3. **Monthly Budgeting System**

Users can:

* Define **monthly budgets** with custom categories (e.g., Food, Utilities, Transportation)
* Assign transactions to these categories
* View total spent vs. budgeted per category per month

#### 4. **Transaction Management (CRUD)**

* Add, edit, delete, and view transactions
* Support for income, expense, and transfer between accounts
* Tag transactions with:

  * **Category**
  * **Date**
  * **Notes**
  * **Related Person** (for lending/borrowing)

#### 5. **Lending/Borrowing Tracker**

* Track money lent to and borrowed from individuals
* Maintain running balances per person
* Filter list of people with outstanding dues
* Option to mark repayments and partial settlements

#### 6. **One-Time vs. Recurring Transactions**

* Flag entries as recurring (e.g., rent, subscriptions)
* Recurring transactions auto-generate monthly or by user trigger

#### 7. **Dashboard & Analytics**

* Visual breakdown of:

  * Spending by category (pie chart)
  * Monthly savings trend (line chart)
  * Net cash flow (income vs. expense)
* Account summary with current balances
* Budget summary with over/under-spent indicators

#### 8. **Data Filtering & Search**

* Filter transactions by:

  * Date range
  * Account
  * Category
  * Person
* Full-text search by notes or keywords

#### 9. **Export/Backup System**

* Export data as `.csv` or `.xlsx`
* Download monthly reports
* (Optional future feature: cloud backups or email export)
